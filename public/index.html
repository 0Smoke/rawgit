        <h2>The Problem</h2>

        <p>
        You've got a <code>raw.githubusercontent.com</code> URL that points to some work-in-progress HTML, JavaScript, or CSS. You'd like to share it with someone for a quick demo, or maybe you'd like to use it in a <a href="http://jsperf.com/">jsPerf</a> test.
        </p>

        <p>
        Too bad! Most things served from <code>raw.githubusercontent.com</code> have a <code>text/plain</code> content type and are served with an <code>X-Content-Type-Options: nosniff</code> header, which means HTML won't render and some browsers won't execute JavaScript or apply CSS.
        </p>

        <h2>The Solution</h2>

        <p>
        Just replace <code>raw.githubusercontent.com</code> with <code>rawgit.com</code> and <em>skadoosh</em>, you're loading raw files from your GitHub repo and they're served with appropriate content types. Render HTML, apply CSS, execute JavaScript.
        </p>

        <p><strong>Before</strong></p>
        <pre class="before">https://<strong>raw.githubusercontent.com</strong>/user/repo/master/filename.js</pre>

        <p><strong>After</strong></p>
        <pre class="after">https://<strong>rawgit.com</strong>/user/repo/master/filename.js</pre>

        <p>
        It works with gists too! Just replace <code>gist.githubusercontent.com</code> with <code>rawgit.com</code> in the raw gist URL.
        </p>

        <h2>The Caveat</h2>

        <p>
        Use this for testing and for sharing demo code with friends, but <strong>don't use it for anything production-related</strong>. It's slow, it might break from time to time, and it's intended as a convenience for development, not free static hosting.
        </p>

        <p>
        If you send production traffic to rawgit.com, evil things will happen to your site. You've been warned!

        <h2>The Source</h2>

        <p>
        The source code for RawGit is <a href="https://github.com/rgrove/rawgithub">hosted on GitHub</a>! Fork it and go nuts.
        </p>

        <h2>The FAQ</h2>

        <h3 id="can-i-use-rawgit-in-production"><a href="#can-i-use-rawgit-in-production">Can I use rawgit.com on a production website?</a></h3>

        <p>
        No. Don't do this. Not even a little bit. It will make me very sad.
        </p>

        <p>
        RawGit is a free service to make developers' lives easier when developing and testing and debugging things. It's not free hosting. Use <a href="http://pages.github.com/">GitHub Pages</a> for that.
        </p>

        <h3 id="what-will-happen-if-im-an-asshole"><a href="#what-will-happen-if-im-an-asshole">What will happen if I hotlink to a rawgit.com URL on a production website?</a></h3>

        <p>
        Bad things. If you hotlink to a rawgit.com URL on a site that gets lots of traffic, requests will be throttled. If this heavy traffic continues, requests originating from your site will eventually be dropped.
        </p>

        <p>
        If the traffic continues even after automatic throttling is triggered, rawgit.com will start serving <a href="/js/evil.js">evil.js</a> and <a href="/css/evil.css">evil.css</a> instead of requested JS and CSS files. Visitors to your site may see an alert warning against using rawgit.com in production, and your JS may start doing very strange things.
        </p>

        <h3 id="but-i-really-want-to-be-an-asshole"><a href="#but-i-really-want-to-be-an-asshole">But I really really want to hotlink to a rawgit.com URL in production!</a></h3>

        <p>
        We can't always get what we want. You should use <a href="http://pages.github.com/">GitHub Pages</a>, which is designed for that. Also that's not a question.
        </p>

        <h3 id="how-do-i-know-if-im-an-asshole"><a href="#how-do-i-know-if-im-an-asshole">How can I tell if I'm sending too much traffic to rawgit.com?</a></h3>

        <p>
        If you asked that question, you're probably sending too much traffic. Are you on the <a href="stats.html#referrers">Top Referrers</a> list? If so, you may want to back off a bit.

        <h2 id="#cdn">The CDN Experiment!</h2>

        <p>
        You deserve a reward for reading this far! How about the chance to help test a brand new super awesome experimental RawGit feature?
        </p>

        <p>
        The lovely people at <a href="http://www.maxcdn.com/">MaxCDN</a> have generously donated CDN hosting to RawGit, and I'd like to use it to provide blazing fast <em>production ready</em> service to RawGit users. That's right &mdash; you may actually be able to use RawGit in production without bad things happening!
        </p>

        <p>
        To try it out, use the hostname <code>cdn.rawgit.com</code> instead of <code>rawgit.com</code>:
        </p>

        <pre class="after">https://<strong>cdn.</strong>rawgit.com/user/repo/tag/filename.js</pre>

        <p>
        I recommend requesting a URL containing a specific tag or commit hash, because once the URL is cached, it will never be updated from GitHub again.
        </p>

        <p>
        When you use <code>cdn.rawgit.com</code>, files will be cached <em>permanently</em> on <a href="http://www.maxcdn.com/">MaxCDN</a>'s super fast global network of edge servers and served directly from the cache for all future requests. Requests to <code>cdn.rawgit.com</code> are not throttled or limited in any way and are not subject to the abuse blacklist (although I do still reserve the right to block blatantly abusive traffic that might affect other users).
        </p>

        <p>
        This feature is currently experimental and may change (so beware!), but I hope to support it as first-class functionality of RawGit very soon.
