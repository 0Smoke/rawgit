<title>Someone is being a jerk - rawgithub.com</title>

<h1>Someone is being a jerk, so rawgithub.com is offline</h1>

<p>
Hopefully <a href="https://github.com/ry778890/abc_super/issues/1">this jerk</a>
will stop being a jerk soon and rawgithub can return. Until then, I've had to
take the site offline to avoid ratcheting up a nasty bandwidth bill. Sorry for
the inconvenience.

<p>
I pay for rawgithub's hosting out of my own pocket, so when people are jerks my
wallet takes the hit. Kinda sucks.
