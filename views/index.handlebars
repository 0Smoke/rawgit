<strong>RawGit</strong> serves raw files directly from GitHub with proper <strong>Content-Type</strong> headers.

        <input id="url-dev" class="url" placeholder="https://{{config.devDomain}}/user/repo/branch/file" readonly>
        </p>

        <p>
        Use <code>{{config.devDomain}}</code> during development to share <strong>temporary</strong> examples or demos with small numbers of people.
        </p>

        <p>
        New changes pushed to GitHub will be picked up within minutes, but <strong>heavy traffic will be throttled and excessive traffic will be blacklisted</strong>.
        </p>

        <p>
        If traffic reaches truly excessive levels, RawGit may display an error message to users on your site to try to get your attention.

        <h2>Production <a class="beta" href="/faq#beta" title="This feature is currently being tested and may change. You've been warned!">beta</a></h2>

        <input id="url-prod" class="url" placeholder="https://{{config.cdnDomain}}/user/repo/branch/file" readonly>
        </p>

        <p>
        Use <code>{{config.cdnDomain}}</code> in production or for large amounts of traffic. Files are cached <strong>permanently</strong> from GitHub on first use and served via <a href="http://www.maxcdn.com/">MaxCDN</a>'s super fast global network of edge servers. There are no traffic limits.
        </p>

        <p>
        Since files are not refreshed after the first request, it's best to use a specific tag or commit URL, not a branch URL.
        </p>

        <p>
        CDN requests aren't subject to throttling or blacklists, but be aware that this is a free service and as such there is <a href="/faq#no-uptime-guarantee">no uptime guarantee or support</a>.
